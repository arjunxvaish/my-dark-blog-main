        <h1>Taiwan's FX Time Bomb</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Taiwanese dollar</strong> has ripped over <strong>10%</strong> since April. Last week’s spike wasn’t noise—it’s the beginning of a structural unwind.</p>

        <h2>Here’s the setup:</h2>
        <p>Taiwan holds $1.7T in FX reserves—around 200% of GDP. Insurers hold $700B, heavily regulated. Another $1T is privately held. Most importantly, there are $450B in USD assets against TWD liabilities—about <strong>60% of GDP unhedged</strong>.</p>

        <p>Taiwan’s life insurers are inherently <strong>long the dollar</strong>. But with <strong>DXY down 9% YTD</strong>, the pain trade is on. Rebalancing has begun.</p>

        <h2>Global Flow Reversal Is Real</h2>
        <p>It’s not just TWD. The euro is also up 10% YTD. SGD is rallying too. This is a coordinated flow reversal. Foreign capital is moving home. Hot money is pulling out of the US.</p>

        <p>From 2012 to 2022, US equities floated between 52–57% of global market cap. Now? <strong>66%</strong>.</p>

        <img src="/my-dark-blog-main/USEQUITYCAP.png" alt="Global equity chart" className="rounded-xl shadow-md my-8" />

        <p>This can resolve three ways: the US stays flat, the rest of the world catches up, or we see a direct correction in the US.</p>

        <h2>The Trade: Rotate Out of the US</h2>
        <p>Look at Brazil’s EWZ—9x P/E and an 8% yield with a China tailwind. In Germany, RWE ADR trades at just 15x P/E, far cheaper than US utilities. Broader DAX and MDAX exposure gives you Siemens, BASF, and Rheinmetall. In defense, Europe’s BAE and Dassault are strong plays.</p>

        <p>On the short side, Mag 7 and the Nasdaq-100 are crowded and long duration. US utilities are trading at 20–25x P/E and have no macro catalyst behind them.</p>

        <p>Long EM and Europe. Short US megacaps. FX pain, capital flight, and global stimulus point to a regime shift.</p>

        <p><strong>If it works?</strong> You’re early.</p>
        <p><strong>If it doesn’t?</strong> You’re not dead.</p>
        <p>This is <strong>how it starts</strong>—not with a bang, but with a <strong>currency squeeze</strong>.</p>
