          <h1>Recession Risk: Delayed, Not Gone</h1>
          <p>Polymarket odds of a U.S. recession have dropped to <strong>42%</strong>, down from 65% in April. That doesn’t mean we’re in the clear—it just means the market got distracted by a rally and a temporary tariff pause.</p>
  
          <h2>Here’s the setup:</h2>
          <p>145% China tariffs were paused—reduced to around 30–45% depending on category. But this isn’t resolution, it’s delay. Deals are still on the table, and the risk clock is still ticking. Equity markets have posted one of the sharpest year-to-date rallies in recent history. But while price action looks euphoric, the macro backdrop looks anything but.</p>
  
          <p>We’re still staring down <strong>$15 trillion in U.S. debt</strong> that needs refinancing. Bond yields are down, but not because confidence is up—because demand is weakening. That’s not a bullish signal. It's a symptom.</p>
  
          <h2>The Consumer Is Struggling</h2>
          <p>Loan delinquencies are climbing fast. Student loan defaults jumped from zero to 6–8% within just weeks of repayments restarting. And the burden isn’t shared evenly—middle and lower income households are carrying the brunt. Real income expectations are falling, sentiment is low, and spending is starting to roll over in discretionary categories.</p>

          <p>The soft underbelly of the economy—credit, sentiment, middle-income resilience—is where the cracks are showing first. This isn’t some abstract macro model. It’s already playing out, at the household level.</p>
  
          <h2>Yield Curve: Flashing Red (Again)</h2>
          <p>From <strong>June 2022 to August 2024</strong>, the U.S. 10Y–2Y yield curve was deeply inverted. For more than two years, short-term borrowing rates exceeded long-term expectations—a classic sign that markets expected a slowdown and rate cuts to follow. Historically, every time the curve has inverted like this, a recession has followed. It happened in the early 1980s, ahead of the 1990 downturn, before the 2000 dot-com bust, and again before the 2008 financial crisis. The inversion doesn’t time the recession—it just telegraphs it. And the duration of this last inversion? One of the longest ever.</p>
  
          <img src="/my-dark-blog-main/10Y-2Y.png" alt="10Y-2Y Yield Curve Inversion" className="rounded-xl shadow-md my-8" />
  
          <p>The curve has only recently un-inverted, climbing back to +51 bps. But that’s not a bullish reversal—it’s often when the actual slowdown begins. The economy gets hit <strong>after</strong> the inversion resolves. Just like in 2007, when the curve normalized... and the real pain began.</p>
  
          <h2>Unemployment & Housing: Classic Red Flags</h2>
          <p>Housing is cooling. New starts are down, affordability is strained, and real estate sentiment is rolling over. Meanwhile, unemployment is ticking up—not spiking, but nudging higher. That’s how it always starts. Unemployment is a lagging indicator. When it really moves, it’s too late.</p>
  
          <img src="/my-dark-blog-main/unemployment.png" alt="Unemployment rate chart" className="rounded-xl shadow-md my-8" />
  
          <p>This is a pattern: credit markets flash first, consumers crack next, yield curves invert, then un-invert, and only after that does labor begin to buckle. We're at stage four.</p>
  
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Tariffs delayed, not resolved. $15 trillion in debt needs refinancing. Consumers are stretched. Defaults are rising. And we’ve just exited one of the longest yield curve inversions in history. Equity markets might not be pricing in a 42% recession probability—but you should be. If it happens, it won’t be a surprise. It’ll be the most predicted, most ignored recession of the decade.</p>
