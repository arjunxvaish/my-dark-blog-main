excerpt: Tariff exposure, fading consumer confidence, and weak guidance line up against GM.

I’m looking at GM and seeing a setup that lines up from multiple angles.

Auto sales are slowing, and consumer behavior is shifting. People aren’t making high-ticket purchases right now. Michigan sentiment keeps printing lower, rates are stuck, and the Fed can’t give a straight answer on anything. That environment doesn’t inspire someone to walk into a dealership and pick up a new car.

Now layer in GM’s exposure to tariffs. About 10% of their operation depends on global imports. If auto tariffs flare up—even as a political bargaining chip—this turns into a margin risk. They don’t have pricing power here. If input costs go up, they either eat it or lose volume. Neither is good.

Then there’s the guidance angle. The last print was cautious. If they keep that same tone this quarter—“watching consumer trends,” “monitoring geopolitical developments,” whatever soft-sell phrase they pick—it’s going to land bearish. That’s especially true with global exposure. You’re not just dealing with U.S. demand softening; you’re dealing with weak conditions across Europe and China too.

So I sized in small and simple.

Sold the $46 put, bought the $46.5 put on GM for the May 2 expiry. Two contracts, filled for **$0.21 net debit**.

Tight spread, cheap entry, short duration. I’m not asking for a collapse—just a soft guide, macro pressure, or another dip in demand to push this a little lower.

**Max risk** on the trade is $42.  
**Max reward** is $58.  
That’s a **1.38:1 risk-reward**, or **+138% return** if GM closes below $46 by expiry.

There’s no demand tailwind. There’s no macro bid. And if tariffs even get mentioned, this gets repriced fast.
