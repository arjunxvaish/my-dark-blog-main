The **Taiwanese dollar** has ripped over **10%** since April. Last weekâ€™s spike wasnâ€™t noiseâ€”itâ€™s the beginning of a structural unwind.

**Hereâ€™s the setup:**
- $1.7T in FX reserves (200% of GDP)
- $700B held by insurers (with stricter regulations)
- $1T privately held
- $450B in USD assets against TWD liabilities = **60% of GDP unhedged**

Taiwanâ€™s life insurers are inherently **long the dollar**. But with **DXY down 9% YTD**, the pain trade is on. Rebalancing has begun.

## Global Flow Reversal Is Real

Since 2019, over **$10T** flowed into US assets. Now itâ€™s reversing:
- TWD +10% YTD  
- EUR +10% YTD  
- SGD also rallying  

Foreign capital is moving home. Hot money is pulling out of the US.

From 2012â€“2022, US equities floated between 52â€“57% of global market cap.  
Now? **66%.**

Thatâ€™s a breakout. But it might fail. Reversion could come via:
1. Flat US  
2. Global catch-up  
3. Direct correction

## The Trade: Rotate Out of the US

**Long:**  
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· **EWZ** â€“ 9x P/E, 8% yield, China tailwind  
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **RWE ADR** â€“ 15x P/E, cheap vs US utilities  
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **DAX / MDAX** â€“ Siemens, BASF, Rheinmetall  
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º **Defense** â€“ BAE, Dassault

**Short:**  
- **Mag 7 / Nasdaq-100** â€“ Overowned, long duration  
- **US Utilities** â€“ 20â€“25x P/E, no macro catalyst

## The Setup

Long EM + Europe. Short US megacaps.  
FX pain + capital flight + global stimulus = regime shift.

**If it works?** Youâ€™re early.  
**If it doesnâ€™t?** Youâ€™re not dead.

This is **how it starts**â€”not with a bang, but with a **currency squeeze**.
