I’ve been watching Lennar for a minute, and this setup heading into earnings looked too clean to ignore.

No need to go deep into macro—everyone knows the environment’s noisy. Rates aren’t budging, housing affordability’s wrecked, and sentiment is weak. What matters here is who gets hit first, and Lennar sits right in the blast zone.

They’re the biggest homebuilder in the U.S., but unlike Toll Brothers, they don’t cater to luxury buyers. Lennar lives in that ~$400K range, where mortgages are tight, buyers are rate-sensitive, and even a mild economic shake shows up in volume.

Margins are getting pressured—not because they’re raising prices, but because they’re throwing in free upgrades, discounted financing, and all sorts of incentives just to keep inventory moving. That kind of stuff eats into gross profit fast. Add labor disruptions from tighter immigration enforcement and the fact that construction timelines are dragging, and you’ve got a clear earnings risk.

Florida exposure makes it worse. That market ran hot, but now you’ve got hurricane insurance issues and more existing inventory hitting the market. Good luck selling new homes into that.

So I kept it simple.

Sold the $118 put, bought the $119 put on LEN for March 21 expiry. **Filled for $0.47.**

It’s a tight spread, cheap structure, and the risk is clean. I’m not swinging for a collapse—just playing the odds on a guidance cut, margin compression, or anything soft that could shake this a bit lower.

**Max risk** on the trade is $47.  
**Max reward** is $53.  
That’s a **1.13:1 risk-reward**, or **+113% return** if LEN closes below $118 by expiry.

Housing doesn’t need to blow up for this to work. It just needs to look a little worse than expected.
